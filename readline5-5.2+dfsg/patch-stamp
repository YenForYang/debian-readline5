Patches applied in the Debian version of :

debian/patches/rl-001 (<doko@ubuntu.com>):
  In some cases, code that is intended to be used in the presence of multibyte 
  characters is called when no such characters are present, leading to incorrect 
  display position calculations and incorrect redisplay. 

debian/patches/rl-002 (<doko@ubuntu.com>):
  In some cases, code that is intended to be used in the presence of multibyte 
  characters is called when no such characters are present, leading to incorrect 
  display position calculations and incorrect redisplay. 

debian/patches/rl-003 (<doko@ubuntu.com>):
  When moving the cursor, bash sometimes misplaces the cursor when the prompt
  contains two or more multibyte characters.  The particular circumstance that
  uncovered the problem was having the (multibyte) current directory name in
  the prompt string.

debian/patches/rl-004 (<doko@ubuntu.com>):
  When restoring the original prompt after finishing an incremental search,
  bash sometimes places the cursor incorrectly if the primary prompt contains
  invisible characters.
